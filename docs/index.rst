Cookiecutter Static Site Template |version| Documentation
=========================================================

This is the documentation for the Cookiecutter static site template,
hosted on `GitHub`_. The template may be used by `Cookiecutter
<https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ to generate a project that
will allow for easy and rapid deployment of a static website (a website
comprised of only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

This documentation is written like a walkthrough, intended for beginners
with little to no programming experience. While this template relies on
programming tools, using the template requires no programming.

If you are a developer, the `Read Me document
<https://github.com/jambonsw/cookiecutter-static-site/blob/master/README.md>`_
in the `GitHub project`_ is likely enough for you.
