# Cookiecutter Static Site Deployment

Rapidly deploy a static website to the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud.

The project generated by this template uses a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) script to quickly create:

- 2 S3 Buckets:
    - a Root Bucket for storing the website
    - a Log Bucket for storing logs from the Root Bucket and CloudFront
- 1 CloudFront Distribution (AWS' Content-Distribution Network [CDN])
- 1 Hosted Zone (a DNS zone)
    - 2 DNS A Records for both domain.tld and www.domain.tld
